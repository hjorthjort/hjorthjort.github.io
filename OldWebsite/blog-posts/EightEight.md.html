<h1 id="the-problem-with-88-or-just-checking-your-math-on-that">The problem with 8^8 (or &quot;Just Checking Your Math On That&quot;)</h1>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I feel pretty confident about the numbers but I am by no means a mathematician and I might have gotten something wrong. If I did, please let me know at my gmail address rikard.hjort</em></p>
<p>This new thing is going viral! It's called <a href="https://8x8x8x8x8x8x8x8.com">8^8</a> and it's a pretty rad idea. Basically, they ask you eight multiple choice questions with eight possible answers to each, which arguably puts you on an 8-dimensional scale of personality. If anyone else gives the exact same answer to every question, you get an email and you are considered &quot;matched with that person&quot;.</p>
<p>The pitch is &quot;Find you soulmate!&quot; which might be a bit over the top, but I get that you want to create a hype. I'm mostly curious to find out what the kind of person that answered the same as me on all those questions is like.</p>
<p>Given the fact that I generally tend to dislike people who are very much like me (very talkative, a bit naïve, among other things – an ENTP on the Myers-Briggs-scale, if that interests you) I don't think I'd hit it off with that person. But given that there are 8^8, or 16,777,216, different ways to answer that questionnaire, I'm very curious to find out who my match might be. It should be a learning experience.</p>

<p>When I shared the link on Facebook my friend pointed out an interesting thing. At the bottom of the page, they have a footer. At the time of this writing, here's what it looks like:</p>
<center>
<img src="blog-posts/eight-eightfooter.png" alt="A picture saying 56,309 TESTS, 0 MATCHES" />
</center>
<p><strong>He said that didn't seem very promising. I thought it seemed very unlikely.</strong></p>
<p>I thought about it and realized why I thought this was off: It's very much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">&quot;The Birthday Problem&quot;</a>, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Birthday Paradox&quot; since the result is counter intuitive. It basically says: &quot;If there are more than 23 people in a room, there's a higher than 50 % chance that two or more of them have the same birthday.&quot;</p>
<p>So I figured I'd run the numbers and, like I thought, something was off. Unlike Zuckerberg in that clip, I did <em>not</em> get the same thing, which is not that strange. This isn't basic arithemtic and the results aren't obvious. I had to use a good deal of googling and Wolfram Alpha.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is the full email I sent to the kind people at <strong>uuave</strong> who created the site.</p>
<p>(I don't go in to the details of there being some configurations that are more likely than others. For example, the combination of &quot;Learning how to manage and lead teams&quot; and &quot;Talent and charisma&quot; on two of the questions might be more likely than the former combined with going to parties and staying &quot;As far as possible, stick to people you know and get along with&quot;. I just assume every combination is equally likely, which should be pretty close to the truth.)</p>

<p>Hey guys! Cool site. Tried out the test today, and looking forward to see if I get a match.</p>
<p>Just a tiny thing. My friend pointed out your meter in the footer. Right now it says:</p>
<p>56,156 TESTS 0 MATCHES</p>
<p>So, that’s weird, right? Is your matches counter not updating?</p>
<p>Basically what you have here is the Birthday Problem: if n people gather in a room, what are the chances that at least two of them share a birthday, if birthdays are evenly distributed throughout the year?</p>
<p>Only in your case, it’s not 365 ”days”, it’s 16,777,216.</p>
<p>I might be missing something here, but that should give us a probability of at least two people matching thus far at a whooping 99.99999999999999999999999999999999999999715018232799 percent.</p>
<p>So, I figure something might be off. Just wanted to let you guys know.</p>
<p>Here’s the math: <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html</a>. The equation to use is: <center><img src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/BirthdayProblem/Inline15.gif" /> = <img src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/BirthdayProblem/Inline20.gif" /></center>. And here’s what Wolfram spits out: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-%288%5E8%29%21%2F%28%288%5E8-56156%29%21*%288%5E8%29%5E56156%29">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-%288%5E8%29%21%2F%28%288%5E8-56156%29%21*%288%5E8%29%5E56156%29</a></p>
<p>Once again, great work, keep it up!</p>
<p>//Rikard</p>

<p>So, I figured that was that. No biggie. Maybe it's just an updating issue, who knows. That felt like the good deed for the day, and I really didn't feel like <em>too</em> much of a math douche. But when browsing for their email, I found this other strange thing. On their (About) page, there is this statement:</p>
<h3 id="the-even-more-math">The even more Math</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="blog-posts/eight-eightabout.png" width="100%" alt="Picture of the words: &quot;For 8^8 to start matching soulmates with each other, statistically, at least 16,777,216 users need to have taken the 8^8 test. Once we hit that number, according to the laws of probability, every new 8^8 user should result in a match.&quot;" />
</div>
<p>If I was in doubt of my own mathy assessments on the previous issue, on this one I felt pretty confident. This is way, way of. And I think that there was something about them invoking the words &quot;the laws of probability&quot; and following it up with a real swing-and-miss that made me decide to put aside the fact that I have an early meeting and a full day of testing ahead of me tomorrow and dig deeper in my limited knowledge of known math problems.</p>
<p>The number of combinations that someone has answered won't be eaten up at a steady pace. Rather, the more people answer, the harder it will be to get a unique combination (or the easier it will be to find a match, if you will). For example: when half of the combinations are &quot;taken&quot;, every other person who answers should be getting a match.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a vague math bell rang on this one as well. I knew there was a problem about baseball cards or something, so I googled around, and there it was: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem">The Coupon Collector's Problem</a>.</p>
<p>This one was a lot trickier to find a good solution for, largely because I couldn't figure out what would constitute a &quot;solution&quot;. I decided a good measure should be what I said above: at what point will half of the combinations be &quot;taken&quot;?</p>
<p>So I sent them one more email. I elaborated a little on my first one and this time I tried to be a little constructive as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, this statement on the About page is kind of strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For 8^8 to start matching soulmates with each other, statistically, at least 16,777,216 users need to have taken the 8^8 test. Once we hit that number, according to the laws of probability, every new 8^8 user should result in a match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You actually reach a 50 percent chance of at least one match being made after about 5 000 people have taken the test. According to the laws of probability – more specifically, the Coupon collector’s problem (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector%27s_problem</a>) – it will take, on average, 288,781,992 before every possible combination of answers has been given. Here’s the calculation in Wolfram: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8%5E8*HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%29">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8%5E8*HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%29</a></p>
<p>A more proper way to phrase your statement would be something along the lines: ”8^8 will start matching soulmates very soon. After 11,629,079 people have taken the test, every second person who takes the test will get a hit.” (Source on that last part: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8%5E8*%28HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%29+-+HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%2F2%29%29">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8%5E8*%28HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%29+-+HarmonicNumber%288%5E8%2F2%29%29)</a></p>

<p>I'll keep you posted on their replies, if I get any. They seem to be getting a lot of traction and attention, so the emails about obscure math problems shouldn't really make the top of the answer-ASAP list.</p>
<p>Math aside, you should check out the site and do the test. It's a really cool idea, and I'm dying to hear peoples stories about their matches.</p>
