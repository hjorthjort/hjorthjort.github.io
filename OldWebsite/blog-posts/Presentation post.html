<h2>The World, Hello</h2>

<p>Welcome, friend, to Stag Land, home of hjorthjort.</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer in the making and a part time artist. I'm currently focusing almost all my energy on learning Java, PHP, HTML/CSS and bash, and reading fiction. Half a year ago the coolest thing I knew how to do with my computer was formatting my hard drive and how to download torrents. Today I'm en route to becoming a PHP developer (summer job). There's little time and lot's to learn.</p>

<p>This site is a learning project.</p>

<p>Achievements won by creating this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up Apache Server</li>
<li>Learning markdown</li>
<li>Writing my first bash script, just a few lines to automatically convert from markdown to html and publishing</li>
<li>First practical use of PHP (previously I have only done tutorials)</li>
<li>Learning div-tags and CSS classes</li>
</ul>

<p>Remaining challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><s>Making my blog tool work for remote work â€“ updating this server from my computer</s> See next post!</li>
</ul>

<p>More to come, I hope.</p>

<p>Please enjoy my <a href="https://github.com/hjorthjort">GitHub</a> responsibly.</p>
