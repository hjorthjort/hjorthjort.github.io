I'm a computer scientist specializing in blockchain, formal verification and programming languages.

My current project is [KWasm](https://github.com/kframework/wasm-semantics).
I want to verify WebAssembly programs on blockchains, especially Ethereum.

This website is mostly long-form blogposts about completely different topics.
It's for the stuff that won't fit in a [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) and I want to be more shareable than a Facebook post.

Happy reading.
