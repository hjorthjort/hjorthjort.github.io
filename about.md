I like dogs more than people, and people more than computers. Interestingly, I spend my days most with computers, and more with people than dogs. 

This blog is a catch-all window of my philosphies to the world. They may reagard software or storytelling. Or they might be stories from unusually interesting hours of my life.

Happy reading.
