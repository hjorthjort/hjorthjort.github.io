Today I applied to become an Estonian e-Resident.
Sometimes this is called an "e-Citizenship", but that is a misnomer.
My citizenship has not changed.
I don't get any new rights similar to what a naturalized Estonian would expect.

So what did I pay 100 euros for?
A login, attached to my identity.

And why would I want that?
Because it will enable me to start an company in Estonia.
It doesn't mean I will be paying taxes in Estonia, or that I intend to move to or visit Estonia (although I might want to open a bank account there at some point).
But it gives me a login to their e-Bureaucracy, where I can deal with the proper authorities and create a new legal entity in a place I have never been.
That feels very 2019.

I'm using [Xolo](xolo.io) for all this.
The product Xolo Leap is priced at 79 euros per month, helping me get started and doing my accounting and taxes.

What do I hope to gain from this? I count three things.
1. Never having to do this again.
   I'm getting ready to relocate to a new EU-country, Germany.
   I don't strictly need to shut down my current business for this, but I predict some nuisances if I don't.
   Moving is already big enough of a deal that I would prefer if it didn't also complicate my business dealings.
   Also, I was intending to create a limited liability company anyway.
   Now I'm doing it in Estonia instead of in Sweden or Germany.
2. A mostly automated accounting flow.
   Xolo seems focused on automation, which gives me the right balance of control and simplicity.
   This is far from unique, there are [similar services in Sweden](https://www.redflag.se/), but I've been excited to try one.
3. Paperless and remote.
   All contact with governments is via email.
   That's not mostly-paperless-and-sometimes-that-really-important-piece-of-paper-you-need-to-hold-onto.
   It's no. Papers.
   (Well, except that ID card, but meh).
   From what I gather, I won't need to save any of my physical receipts once I have digitized them, wheras in Sweden I need to keep the physical copies of all my receipts for 3 years.
   I can get a physical address from Xolo, and every piece of mail they get they scan and send to me.
   This truly sounds like heaven.
3. Ease of expansion/transition.
   If I want to upgrade to a more advanced tax and accounting service, I will be able to do so without setting foot in anyone's office.
   There also seems to be a good amount of service providers that specialize in what other jurisdictions shy away from: blockchain and cryptocurrency activities.

I generally expect this experience to be smooth (except having to make a visit to Stockholm and perhaps one to Tallin in the future).
But I foresee some possible problems:

1. Local tax-advisors may not be hip to it.
   I suspect I will want to (and need to) engage a German advisor, so I can only hope I will be able to find one who doesn't mind the slighty unorthodox setup.
2. I don't speak the local language (though all information is available in English) which could become annoying if I for some reason need to deal with a local government, or a court.

The Process
===========

I'll outline the steps here in my [wiki](https://github.com/hjorthjort/wiki) for my reference, and for others.
