Specialization breeds alienation. [Marx covered
this](ihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation). But I
want to extend on the idea a bit further, and place it in the context uf the
ultra-modern capitalist economic machine.

Specialization in profession leads to strange alienation between the customer
and the service worker, between the client and the clerk. In some "simpler
time" (which one that is depends on what profession we mean), the customer
comes expecting to have some understanding of what the world of the specialist
is like. The designs of their buildings and the motions they go through make
some sense, and convey mastery, or deliberateness, or care. But under a
hyper-specialized profession the motions seem foreign, almost distant, to the
customer, because the system that has engendered them is so vastly complex that
hardly even the people managing it understand how it came to be.

How could the call center worker at Big Corp trigger any empathy in the the
angry customer, when the customer is angry because they believe Big Corp tricked
him in to signing a subscription they didn't want -- when actually, the shady
salesman was from another company working on commission, evading responsibility
by being unreachable and mostly invisible, while working under the big name
brand of the call center worker, and the only job of the call center worker is
to take the abuse and never route the caller to a manager, or someone who could
actually solve the problem. The worker is an extremely specialized part in a
complex machine that bears no resemblance to what the customer would call
"service".

Or take the physician, working in a strange Moloch of a hospital with
arcane procedures and flows, making complex calculations of benefit in their
head, struggling with questions of philosophy -- when is life not worth living?
is this person's life worth more than that person's? -- that the customer has
been increasingly shielded from by the very same complex system. By virtue of
modern healthcare being so efficient and magnificent, it has simultaneously
become more scary and arbitrary-seeming for anyone it tries to heal, while also
shielding that person from disease and death and the mechanics of their own
body for most of their life.

Our alienation from each other under current conditions goes beyond just
workers competing, and commodifying themselves. It's even more strange, even
more confused, and even more invisible than that. Any single worker may glimpse
their own personal alienation. But to the customer (or client, or citizen),
trying to make the strange machine do his bidding, the worker becomes doubly
alienated by being both a cog in that machine, and being an incomprehensible
cog, because the machine is so darn complex.
