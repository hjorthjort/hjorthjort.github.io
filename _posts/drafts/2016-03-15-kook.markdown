Idea
====

A markup language for reciepies that is super simple to use (like markdown).

Why?
----

Because I hate scrolling in recipies on a tiny screen, they sometimes forget an ingredient, and because why not?

How?
----

Works a bit like LaTeX, where you reference stuff and it does magic.

You could write your recipie in parts (main, sauce, etc), announcing every ingredient in the text as it shows up, together with the amount, maybe in [bracket] or something similar to make it stand out.

It should also support having ingredients that are optional (maybe those that are placed in optional steps of the recipie), good ways for marking steps optional, offering possible exchangable ingredients, and should be highly legible even when viewed in raw format.

It should output html, possibly into separate files, and perhaps also outputting to markdown.

Names
-----

* CookUp
* Cook
* BookCook

What should the post be about?
==============================

The post should be a definition of the language: what constructs it accepts, what they represent and how they should be outputted to different other formats.

The idea is that the language should be *simpler* than existing markups, so that it can be transformed into them easily, while still having a few tools that makes writing recipies a breeze.

Inspiration
===========

Cookbooks. Do this by rasoning from first principles. Don't go out trying to see how others have done it. Use a few cookbooks to think how it should be, and think from scratch.
