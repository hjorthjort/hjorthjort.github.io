This is one of the topics that have bothered me for years. So now, in a spurt
of explicitness about my ideas instigated by reading some sweet, sweet [Wait But
Why][wbw][^1] and drinking a glass or two of bourbon. It is something I call
the Deathbed Fallacy.

# What is the Deathbed Fallacy

A common truism is that people on their deathbeds regret not spending more
time of their life with their family, traveled more, etc. It comes up in
discussions on personal growth, religion, spirituality and happiness. A [viral
post][deathbed] on this theme says that the following is what people regret
most on their deathbed:

1. I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
2. I wish I didn’t work so hard.
3. I wish I’d had the courage to express my feelings.
4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.

All well and good. A bit vauge, but seems like fine advice. So what is the
problem?

# The Fallacy

The fallacy is to assume that whoever you are on your deathbed knows how you
should live your life. If you consider yourself over a lifetime not as a
single person, but a spectrum of many people with different views and
priorities, you shouldn't think that the last person on that spectrum is super
wise and all-knowing. There are two reasons to doubt that the deathbed is a
good guide for leading a good life.

## Reason 1: It is not a representative state

The deathbed is not a representative state of life, and what you want when you
are there might not have much correlation with what would have been the most
happy, satisfactory and/or meaningful life you could have led.

The deathbed you is very special in a few ways:

* They don't have a future at all. They are about to die, and nothing they
  think has bearing on the future. All they have is the present and memories.
* They think they know their past selves (such as you) very well, but probably
  don't. More on that soon.
* Like all your temporal selves, they are locked in a time, place and life
  situation that does not necessarily correspond to yours.
* Most people now on their deathbeds were my age long ago, and probably held
  different values and core ideas. Do you agree with your grandparents'
  philosophy of life? Do you think you should?

## Reason 2: You don't know your past selves, but you think you do

The older I get, the more I think I understand myself as a teenager. As I learn more about myself, I seem to grasp my motivations and my core ides ever more fully. I think of past me as [nothing but a slightly less grown up version of me][smbc], but still overestimate my knowledge and capabilities of that time so that they are closer to my current self. 

Nevertheless, I often find something I wrote in high school, or remember something I
did, which reminds me that the idea I generally hold of my past self as stupid
and wanting the wrong things is ridiculous. I was smart back then too – I just
had a different outlook, and different priorites. I did things I today think
are stupid, but which, if I were to go back and relive my experiencesof that
time, would probably do again. Case in point: for a few years, when I was 14 to 15 I would guess, a strong priority in my life was fitting in. And I don't mean beacuse I thought that was a great end goal, but beacuse that would give me the most utility. My core ideas were the same as now, in many ways,
and I valued independence, but I realized that I *sucked* in many ways and that people in
general weren't very fond of me. I also realized that no matter how
enlightened or clever I got, my overall happiness depended a lot on how other
people saw me, and what relationship we developed. So I became obsessed with
other people's opinion of me. 

Today, I probably care too much about what others think. I often blame
teenage me for making me so aware of other people's judgement – why can't I
just focus on computer science and meditation all the time with a select few
people I love? – but honestly, I realize he did what is best for us.

In much the same way, I am now highly career foucesd. I want to learn a shit lot,
I want good jobs, I want money. I am in a place where deathbed me would
probably scowl and think of a lost boy with twisted priorities. But I am doing
this for us. I don't care about having a career or money, excpet for as
enablers of a good life, a life of freedom, a life in a great place with great
people. I believe that hard work can form a life I would enjoy more than the
one I'd get if I just focused on being happy, because even my idea of
happiness is probably skewed in a lot of ways. I'm doing the best I can based
on what I know. And that doesn't come free. I happen to believe that a lot of the
people I would love the hang out with are people in places it is actually hard
to get to. [The brick walls are there for a reason][brick-walls], and I want
to spend as much of my time as possible with the people on the other side of
it.

I am beginning to acknowledge that where I am at is the result of serious
work (and serious play), and that unless I think this is the end of the line
for me, I should probably try to keep going. I should balance that with
enjoying the ride, trying to be happy and find the work I find meaningful
enough to want to do a lot, and spending time with people I love. But I should
also acknowledge that I need to develop some mastery of skills and general
esteem, as those are awesome amplifiers for any life.

I am completely ignorant about teenage me, even though I know more about him
than anyone. Why do I have so much respect for deathbed me? And why should I
care what he thinks?

# Who is most guilty of this fallacy?

In my experience, hedonists who "figure out" what life is really about seem to be pretty far
up in Maslow's pyramid of needs, and have a lot of focus on the higher parts,
and they tend to be smart people that have figured out some way to make a
decent living that allows them a lot of time to think and personal freedom to
explore experiences. I'd say that a lot of these people are, or have been,
workaholics. And that has taken them to a place where they now have the luxury
of thinking about The Real Important Things In Life™, casting judgement on
their former selves for not seeing clearly when a precondition for them to be
able to think clearly in the first place is the work they already put in.

In short, people who already have a lot seem to assume that if they never even
strived for it, they would be happier. But that striving is often an enabler
of the life they now think they want. It is what gave them their family, ther
network, their passions.

# Conclusion

Why are smart people so amazingly eager to assume that they know what their
former selves *should* have done? And I don't mean single, life changing
decisons here, for which they know the turnout, but
general, large scale attitudes on how to live life.

Please, don't have to much respect for deathbed you. They are in a weird place,
where the future is suddenly completely unimportant and the past is
everything. Is that who you want to be dictating your life?

*This post might be a work in progress. I hope I can clarify my ideas further,
but I want to put them out there as the draft they are.*
