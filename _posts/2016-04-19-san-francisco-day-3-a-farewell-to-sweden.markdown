Sweden, you've been great. But I'm not coming back. This place is just to great to stay away from, and I want to stay here for the next few years. After visiting The Big Three of this trip – Stanford, Google and Facebook – I've just seen to much of what this place has to offer.

Knowing that my mother reads this, at this time I want to calrify that I *am* coming back to Sweden. It's just that I'm hellbent on going back to San Francisco. Sorry for the heart attack, mom.

# Stanford

The first stage of mind blow was going to Stanford. A girl from Chalmers doing her masters here towed us around. First she said that the place is really big, so she *had* to use a bike to get around – on wide, unworn asphalt roads between centery old buildings. Doesn't sound like to much of a hassle to my ears. She showed us parts of the huge collection of [Rodin][rodin] sculptures, including [Gates of Hell][gates], [Orpheus][orpheus] and [The Thinker][thinker]. They were all there in bronze cast, in outdoor sculpture parks for everyone to touch, see and contemplate, right next to cafés and study halls. She showed us the first Google server, on display outside of a lecture hall. We walked around the sprawling campus, seeing all the restaurants and frat activities, going into the massive bookstore, seeing people enjoy the sun while toiling over their books. It was heaven.

## Going across the pond

We all asked our guide a ton of questions. Mine were all a variation on a single theme: how do I get here?

The answers turned out to be both expected and surprising. Yes, it is very hard to get in, an the process is long. You need good marks and recommendation letters. Yes, it costs more than my entire body of student loans in tuition *for a single semester*. No, there is no exchange between Stanford and Chalmers for students in Software Engineering. So it is, as expected, *super hard* to study here.

On the other hand, she was brutally optimistic. If there is a will, there is a way. One way is through scholarships, that can pay part of or all of the tuition. This is a viable path if you have good marks and have some extra curricular activities to show for your time as a bachelor student. These include [Fulbright][fulbright], the [Martina & Willhelm Lundin Scholarship][lundin] and [the Wallenberg Scholarships][wallenberg]. Check – this might work. But it is not a safe thing to rely on.

Another way to pay for tuition is as a teaching assistant. By administrating a course and tutoring, one can pay a sizeable chunk of one's tuition. And some people suggesting trying to get funding from non-standard sources, like companies and innovation institutions.

The school is amazing in every conceivable way. The research is cutting edge in almost every field. The courses are challenging but rewarding. The campus is beautiful. The people are friendly. Campus life is rich and varied. The weather is to die for.

So, there's only one thing left for me to do. I need to keep reminding myself that this is possible and how much I want it[^motivation], and then start the process of transeferring, whatever it might take. To remind myself, I made sure to buy a t-shirt, a sticker and a hat with the Stanford logo. I plan to keep these on display in my home, and wear them in public. That way, I *have* to go. Otherwise I'll just be some guy that has a bunch of swag from a university I have no affiliation with. I don't want to be that person. I want to be at Stanford.

[^motivation]: This is actually part of my motivation to write this blog post – to remind myself of what I felt at Stanford (and at Google and Facebook) so that I will not convince myself that it wasn't that great and I'm better off at home, and also to put in writing all the advice I got on how to start that process.
