Smartphones have been called ["slot machines in our pockets"](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/smartphone-addiction-is-part-of-the-design-a-1104237.html). The [Time Well Spent movement](http://humanetech.com/) is challenging the media giants' focus on hijacking our attention. Outrage is growing over issues such as "fake news" and other artificially viral content, to the extent that major advertising players are [pushing back with their wallets](http://www.foodingredientsfirst.com/news/unilevers-advertising-ultimatum-to-facebook-and-google-clean-up-toxic-content.html).

I do feel, however, that there is a signal that platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, and Instagram, as well as media houses, are missing: how I felt my attention was used.

The algorithms that vie for our attention all rely on *signals*: pieces of data that can inform their decisions. We create a torrent of signals that the data-hungry models gulp up. A click is a signal. Time spent on a web page is a signal. Comments, reactions, where you have just been and where you go next, all signals that are used to create new content recommendations which generate new signals which generate new recommendations. And so it goes on.

As the media giants come under pressure for a sole focus on maximizing "engagement," which translates to "time spent on our platform," we can only hope the incentive to keep users happy, not just engaged, will lead to new recommendation strategies.

[Youtube maintains that they already optimize for more than watch time](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth) by using surveys and looking for how the user engages by liking or disliking content. But the like and dislike reactions are not signals of how happy we are with how we spent our time. They are signals that say "good job" or "boo!". They don't indicate whether we were happy with our decision to watch or not. And surveys are bothersome and don't generate much data, at least not the volume that neural network models gulp up.

The common theme for all signals is this that they only cover how we feel about the content, not how we feel about *having consumed* the content. This is an important distinction. When I like a long Facebook post, does that mean I'm happy I took the time to read it? I say no. That is me publicly condoning the contents. When I fail to like, share, comment, reply or use whatever other mechanisms are in place on a platform, or when I downvote or dislike, does that mean I think the content was a waste of time? Again, no, I don't think so. Instead, that is me signaling my level of agreement.

But what do I do when I'm left drained? When I feel like this was a waste of my precious time? Sending any signal at all will likely lead to me getting more similar content. But then again, so did clicking it. Once I engaged with the material, my fate was sealed: I will now be seeing more of it. I have to judge my clicks carefully.

Chances are you've seen a [HappyOrNot terminal](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/customer-satisfaction-at-the-push-of-a-button) while shopping. The Finnish company makes terminals with four smiley faces where you can rate your satisfaction level as you leave the store. It's a simple, anonymous signal. [It's a smash hit].(https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/05/customer-satisfaction-at-the-push-of-a-button)

Here's what I propose (all you unicorn social media companies out there, take heed): After clicking on content, whether it be a long post, a news article, a video or a tweet thread, show me a HappyOrNot terminal. No, this isn't another chance for you to broadcast my like or dislike to the world. This is you collecting data on me (I keep giving it to you for free, don't I), and it stays between us. Ask me: "How was your experience?" Take my signal, and do what you want with it. I hope you will gear me towards content I'm glad for, which includes what I disagree with. And hey, you are making me a little more mindful as a bonus. All in all, my level of enjoyment with your platform is bound to go up.
