Welcome, friend, to Stag Land, home of hjorthjort.

I'm a software engineer in the making and a part time artist. I'm currently
focusing almost all my energy on learning Java, PHP, HTML/CSS and bash, and
reading fiction. Half a year ago the coolest thing I knew how to do with my
computer was formatting my hard drive and how to download torrents. Today I'm
en route to becoming a PHP developer (summer job). There's little time and
lot's to learn.

This site is a learning project.

Achievements won by creating this site:

* Setting up Apache Server
* Learning markdown
* Writing my first bash script, just a few lines to automatically convert from
  markdown to html and publishing
* First practical use of PHP (previously I have only done tutorials)
* Learning div-tags and CSS classes

Remaining challenges:

* ~~Making my blog tool work for remote work â€“ updating this server from my
  computer~~ See next post!

More to come, I hope.
