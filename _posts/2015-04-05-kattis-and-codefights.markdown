What is Code Fights
---

Today I stumbled across [CodeFights][code-fights], a competitive setting for
programming problems. You face off against another player, and then have 3
minutes to read a problem, understand the code and fix the bug that has been
inserted.

I find time pressure locks me down hard and keeps me from thinking clear, so
it's a challenge to keep a cool head, and I feel I'm getting better at it. I
recommend signing up and then [adding me as CodeFriend][code-fights-addme] so
we can fight!

What is Kattis 
---

I've been hard at work learning PHP, and found this website, [Kattis][kattis]. It's a
collection of programming problems which you can submit answers to in a bunch
of different languages. If you successfully solve the problem you get points
and your ranking goes up. If you fail, you usually beat yourself up and go
bughunting.

Since Kattis is mainly built around textual input and output, it's very
important that you nail the format of the output perfectly. It took me half an
hour to figure out why I got the reusult "Wrong Answer" for [this
problem][kattis-dicegame] when I thought my execution was flawless: Instead of
outputting "Emma", I was outputting "Emmma".

Common denominator
---

There are now tons of sites around focused on learning and practicing coding
skills, like Codeacademy, Coderbyte and the aforementioned sites. The thing I
feel is lacking on most these places are the depth: I would like to see some
bigger challenges, more project-like, that requires some serious object
oriented programming to solve efficiently.
