<!-- Physicians are often held as the pinnacle of professions. They are the most important contact for people in the most dire of times, and they may give us our life back when we are about to lose it. The professions is as old as civilization, and like many other professions, modernization rendered it cold, but efficient. Indeed, a common complaint among patients is that they don't feel their doctors have properly listened to their worries and as a result, they feel apprehensive towards their prescribed treatment â€“ or lack thereof. -->

<!-- Maybe run the weight loss regimen situation trhough the entire intro? -->

Have you ever been to the doctor and gotten the cold, professional treatment? Where tests were taken and straight questions asked, but you did not get any chance to voice your concerns. The doctor seems to treat you like a puzzle, not a person. Or they immediately diagnose you with some mild bacterial infection and sends you off with an antibiotics prescription. Or worse: they hospitalize you, but don't consult with you much about your treatment; they don't ask you what is going to happen, they tell you. Who are you to pipe up? They're the expert with years of training: you barely passed biology in high school. If they are condecending, you probably just asked the wrong questions.

Studies show [which ones?] that this kind of doctor-patient relationship often result in patients stopping their regimens, a higher rater of rehospitalizations and generally lower satisfaction with health care. I'm sure you can find a handful of people among your friends who are apprehensive about going to the doctor at all. It's already very draining to worry about your health without feeling like an idiot. That's why you see paradoxical behaviors such as denial and repression, even in the face of diagnosis: feeling powerless and like your doctor doesn't really care about *you* has a big effect on whether you will take their advice or not.

On the contrary, when your doctor engages you, asks you about your general state of well-being, explains to you the pros and cons of different treatments, and encourage you to ask questions, you feel involved. Like you can do this. You can follow the regimen, whether it's 10 pills a day that make you groggy or a weight loss plan.

When you work in software, you often hear user-bashing. People saying something is obvious ("Don't store passwords in plaintext!"), or that something is too hard for them to understand ("Don't roll your own crypto!"). But it is only obvious after a good deal of training in writing software. Ask a smart kid starting a CS degree with little programming experience about these things, and they will shrug. Not to mention your friends and family who almost take pride in not being computer savvy. And there are thousands of these advice we expect people to follow. Don't click on weird links in e-mails. Don't reuse passwords. Don't do sensitive stuff on an open wifi.

Do people listen? Some do. Many don't. One big reason for not listening to expert advice, I think, is the lack of attunement in that advice. We didn't really hear their concern, we just wrote a prescription. We didn't ask about their fears and motivations. We didn't give them a say. We were bad doctors, and we should accept the blame
