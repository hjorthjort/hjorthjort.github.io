The Listening Society: A critical review
========================================

I'll be blunt: This book may change your life, and it may go down in history as a great and accesible piece of (pop-)philosophy. However, I sense ther are some *serious* pitfalls to reading and applying it. Looking around the web at the comments of others, it seems my concerns are well founded. I encourage you to go out and read it (it is quite short and challenging yet pleasant read), but please take some of my concerns with you as you do.

I will start by saying: I generally agree with Hanzi. The book is in essence philosophical, and as such, can't reach for science to back everything up, but instead needs to resort to reason, observation, and intuition. The book is, however, well researched as for as I imagine is possible, and relies heavily on modern sociology. I think it will be able to stand up to critique well, given that its readers also practice a bit of criticism.

But before we can critique, we need to get a grip of what we are actually talking about here: Metamodernism.

What is Metamodernism, and why should you care?
--------------------------------------------------------

Much of the 20th century has been characterized by "modernism", a  sort of catch-all phrase for a sort of pragmatic, rational take on reality, which still is held in high regard in most of the world as the pinnacle of human culture. But since the late 60's, more and more chinks in the modernist armor have become aparent: scientists bring their own biases to the table and [they don't get cancelled out properly](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-social-epistemology/), the rational market can't handle its own large-scale side effects, and as the middle class has become more prosperous in the west, material wealth has become of less importance. This anti-modern movement, which is today at the forefront in both politics and media in the most well-of countries in the world, is usually dubbed postmodernism. Postmodernism hasn't taken over the world just yet, but it will. But then what?

On [his blog](https://metamoderna.org/), Hanzi Freinacht[^Hanzi is, as far as I can tell, a nome-de-plume of two dudes named Daniel GÃ¶rtz and Emil Ejner Friis, but I'm happy to play along with their fiction.], has been thinking about what comes after postmodernism. He chose the name "metamodernism", and it's a sort of Hegelian synthezis of modernism and postmodernism.

According to Hanzi Freinacht, 

 "Metamodernists define themselves through the struggle of value memes against
 value memes: It's not if you're Right or Left that matters the most, but how
 complex your thinking is."

To explain this point properly, we first need to cover some basic terminoligy, starting with "value memes".

The value memes
-------------------------

A value meme is a persons general outook on self, society and ontology. A sort of framework for thinking about most of society and, to some extent, about yourself. In each such outlook, certain values will naturally emerge, at least the broad strokes. So for example, you will have most modernists holding the separation of state and church, as well as good science education in high regard, as well as fair and open competition. In the same way, postmodernists will generally value radical inclusion and the righting of historical and contemporary wrongs. The value memes coexist, so you have a world populated by both premodernists[^There are several premodern value memes, and Hanzi describes them in detail], modernists and postmodernists all at the same time, vying for the hearts of people.

The value memes are memes in that they are uniquely well adapted to a certain developmental stage of society. The modern value meme could take much of the world by storm starting around the Enlightenment. This was because the previous value meme (called Postfaustian), dominated by religion, naturally decreased in power: salvation became less important and attractive in the face of equality, rationality, individualism and industrilazation. Societies were well of enough that people could start looking for scientific truth, starting with the elites and trickling down. Once the modern perspective had started spreading, there was no stopping it. In much the same way, postmodernists are comming to dominate academia, politics, industry, and media, because they understand the globalized human condition better than the moderns. The postmodernists can reach and touch people in a ways that resonate with new, alienated generations in well off nations. 

So what does the metamodern value meme bring to the table?

The metamodern value meme is uniquely well equipped to handle contention and conflict in a globalized world. Whereas postmodernists happily pay lip-service to marginalized perspectives, there is still the idea that postmodernism is the real deal, what everyone should get down with, and that the power structures and racists are some sort of ineherent evil that can be taken down, torn apart. In a globalized world with every meme from faustian to postmodern represented, the postmodern meme will take heavy fire. The growing right-wing nationalist movements in Europe is an excellent example of postmodernists completely alienating huge groups of people, who view the bleeding hearts in media and politics as the bitter enemy. Metamodernism is about a more radical inclusion, hearing, empathasizing and considering the perspecite of the nationalists, the crypto-liberals and the queer-feminists. As such, they become less disagreeable. They are a more attractive alternative to the postmodern reigh to the lower memes, and will therefore outcompete the postmodernists, in time.

Hierarchies among humans
------------------------

This is all well and good -- a high-level, abstract view of human culture -- but Hanzi shines in his meticulous approach to human development, relating them to the value memes. Basically, to be receptible for a higher value meme, you need to have developed further in four different dimensions (or just really far in one or two of them). 

The models of human development that Hanzi steals, modifies and constructs are the real reason you should read this book. The idea of metamodernism, and its future supremacy, is a good reason for you to do so, but these models are your toolkit. Much like understanding personality types like Myers-Briggs or Big Five will help you navigate your personal relationships better, so will these models help you not only with that, but also thinking about politics, sieving brilliance from banality, and improving yourself.

The four models are quite simple, but contain a lot of detail. Again, I encourage you to read the book to get the detailed view. But in brief, there models are:

* The Model of Hierarchical Complexity (MHC), a way of classifying just how complex ideas you are able to come up with and understand. The concept is wider than IQ or creativity.
* Symbol stages or "Code", which explains how deep your understanding of reality is. While a thinker like Aristotle might have been brilliantly complex, he didn't know shit about physics. Any undergrad outsmarts him in math and psychology. Why? Because just by virtue of being born 2400 years later, they automatically learn a lot more about the world, and thus can analyze things which Aristotle would have struggled with, or resorted to some of his typical magical explanations.
* Emotional state. Basically, how happy or sad are you, right now and in general, on a scale from "depths of hell" to "bliss only rivaled by the prophets", with most people hanging around the "very uneasy" to "pretty damn good" zone.
* Emotional depth. How many states have you expereinced, and integrated into your understanding? The more emotional states you can empathize with, the greater your depth.

Again, just getting access to these models is enough reason for you to go out and get this book. You'll find all the gritty details there.


The critique
------------

Again, I loved this book. You should read it too. I think you'll love it. I don't believe all the warnings about how you need to be a certain level of smart to get the points. I think the more readers, the more good criticism we'll see, so that even the metamodern perspective can evolve out of its current brittle, vulnerable, untested state.

### The problem of Hanzi

Okay, so I will address the fiction of Hanzi Freinacht, if only to make the following point clear. Hanzi, in the book, often references his own academic career, research and mentors. This is strange, since Hanzi doesn't exist. He of course has no published research. Neither do the names behind the fictional Hanzi, as far as I've been able to find. A Google Scholar search reveals only a Bachelor's thesis of one of the creators at Lund University. So every time Hanzi references his own involvement in academia, I cringe.

I don't mean I don't trust anyone without a PhD or a good citation score. Good ideas can come from anywhere. But why on Earth would you employ such a clear Ethos argument that is not only patently false, but also absurd? The only reason I can think of is that the author(s) are playing with some sort of [hyperreality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality), creating an image of Hanzi that is just as real to the reader as any actual reality could ever be. I can see the point. I can see how it would make you question the authority of other scholars. Seriously, how often do you follow the sources in your non-fiction literature, read the original papers, look up biographies? But even so, it mostly seems dishonest to me. -10 style points.

### The writing

Like with all works of philosophy, you get the ideas only by also swallowing the prose. I found Hanzi's writing both funny and cringeworthy. It's a thin line he's balancing. The author's voice in my head is that of that really smart person at a party that also *knows* they're really smart, loves the sound of their own voice and is a little too confident in their own sense of humor.

I can definitely see the writing in itself turn off some readers. Indeed, it almost happen to me. Not because it's bad, but because it is a little oboxious. This seems to be by design. It's engaging. And it only really shows up in the interludes between the meatier parts of the book. So don't worry too much, sigh out loud if you need to and read on.

### Don't finish the Kool-Aid

If you ask me, you should plunge into this book and open your mind to it. Embrace the ideas, practice thinking with the models you are given. But careful, or you might just be joining one of the annoying, pointless cults that Hanzi loves bashing.

That's because a major theme of the book is that of exclusivity: If you get it, you are part of the elite. People who don't get your perspective, or hold certain ideals or ideas, are essentially at a lower stage of development than you. They couldn't possibly understand. This follows directly from the model, but by God, is this a recipie for disaster, jabbing it into the hands of young and hungry intellectuals who are already likely to perceive most people to be stupid burgoise atomatons, whereas they are complex thinkers who "get it". The kind of people who think that if they only would put *them* in charge, or people just were more like them, they'd set this society straight and we'd have a perfect liberal capitalist scientific mindfullness socialist-egalitarian utopia. Thus the book doesn't only give you a pass to put yourself on the pinnacle, it is also in itself a litmus test that says that if you get it, you're good, and the critics still have some way to go. The book is self-referential, since it describes human development, so that any opinion you have on it also reflects your development stage, and thus your understanding of the book.

I googled this book. I read the Amazon reviews and the blog posts. And the recurring theme is that everyone who read it and wrote about it a) are super excited about it (hey, some am I!), and b) find some way to justify exactly why they now belong to a chosen tribe, (they didn't read it and concluded that no, I'm not at the pinnacle), and c) think it fits perfectly into their pet perspectives, and massage it so that it fits.

Don't deceive yourslef. Open your mind, but don't let your brain fall out.

### Lack of solutions

A main point of criticism of postmoderism in the book is its ineptitude, its inability to give any real solutions to the problems of modernism. Metamodernism as presented here does seem promising, but it really only shifts the problem one step up: instead of just "being better and more inclusive" as the pomos say, we need to "develop humans along 4 dimenstions". We can do this by building a listening society. In this society, the premodern, modern and postmodern ideas get to talk to the metamodern idea, and the metamodernists synthesize solutions. In this society, we listen beyond our ideological confines.

Hanzi keeps going on about how we should be able to create institutions, a society, that supports development. But in a modern (or postmodern) democracy, how would this be done? It would entail some acceptance of the metamodern ideas, and support for the idea of hierarchies among humans. Perhaps the closest example is the center-leftist, postmodern Nordic countries, whith a postmodern elite. I think its easy (and I think Hanzi would agree) to convince pomos that we should "develop" the poor modernists and post-faustian racists, at least into postmodernists. But good luck having the general population agreeing, the population to which all postmodernists sound liky hippie, animistic, astological-precariat thinkers who have completely missed, not surpassed, modernism and post-faustianism. And to some extent, they are right. There are many postmodernists who don't have a damn clue what they're doing, but they have a "flattened" view of the postmodern code, as Hanzi would put it. If this was math, then they can perform calculations, but they don't know the proofs, but they *think* they do and come off sounding silly. So how do we develop everyone? That is a question that remains unanswered. The solution is promised in the follow-up book *Outcompeting Capitalism*.


What make the book great
------------------------

Even though it might not be useful for political change in the now (that might change with the next book) the proposed models and value meme classifications make for excellent and robust analytical tools. It is hard not to categorize people once you see the models in play, and to do so in a way that gives you some predictive power, at least so I've found since I finished the book. Rarley does non-fiction leave me with such a fresh perspective on the human condition, such an expansion of understanding.

I also think this book might help spark a real political shift. If we put it in the hands of the ambitious and empathetic, I think they will be better equipped to curb some disturbing trends. Even though I of course lack data to back it up, it does seem like are two rampant kinds of disenfranchisement that make the metamodern value meme seem promising, and the hierarchy models useful. 

The first is the growing disenfranchisement between the ruling classes and the people in many modern welfare states, giving rise to strong xenophobic sentiments and value meme regression, evident in facists rising in Europe and the US. The ruling classes are most often postmodern, whereas the modern value meme is still dominating society in general. Hanzi calls the [Alt-Right postmodern](https://metamoderna.org/4-things-that-make-the-alt-right-postmodern), and I think he's right. But the Alt-Right are great at rallying the premodernists and postmodernists, giving their values a place in the utterly postmodern, globalized world.

The second is a similar disenfranchisement on the other end of the political scale: many on the left are growing tired of the postmodern approach. Even as the postmodernists rally more people behind feminism and egalitarianism, they do so in a way that is in many ways unproductive, more focused on criticism of modernity and emphasis on personal expression than actual material or spiritual improvements.As a political movement, the strong identity politics make postmodern politics a hard project to be part of for those with a foot still in the modern project and its hopefullness, as modernism is the great enemy of postmodernism, disallowing much nuance. Metamodernism offers a more nuanced perspecitve and allows doubters in to the curch of progressiveness.

Let's talk further
------------------

Read the book and let me know your thoughts. There are more points of criticism and praise that deserve attention than I could fit in this already quite long post, so I welcome some discussion. I'd love to hear what you think.

You can pick up the book [here](http://amzn.asia/68l1WKu)

P.S. I found a great little article that tries to distuingish value systems, and criticize them. It is called [*The World's Most Toxic Value System*](http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/PSEUDOSC/TOXICVAL.HTM). The value system in the title, called *thar* in the article, corresponds well to the "Faustian" value meme. I highly recommend that article as an intro to thinking about value systems if you, like me, are a bit relativistic to begin with. Go back and read the article again after finishing Hanzis book, and you will see what the book have taught you.
