At least according to [this article][vox-rise-of]. 

In all fairness, I'm simplifying. They are looking at at specific paralell to Hitler, namely his infamous rise to power among what seemed to be quite ordinary people – Germans – during extraordinary times. The article linked above is an exposé over an interesting, relatively young field: the study on authoritarianism.[^spelling-authoritarianism]


SCRATCHPAD
----------

Key points:

### Hitler Hitler Hitler Hitler – a word about the obsession

### Scientific rigor in the article

The field seems intersting. The article say things like "eeire" and "prescient", but that seems to be based on gut feeling and "this guy is bad"-vibe

### The field in general

The basis is questions about childcare, specifically 4 of them. No mention of how they checked that they seem to correlate with the rest of the stuff that makes you authoritarian.

### The census the made

Vox say somewhere that they performed a census to find out the degree of authoritarianism in states. No mention of using those results.

### Putting money where mouth is

So, if this is such a great predictor ... there should be money to be made, right? 

Assumptions:

* Trump has a good chance of becoming GOP candidate, let's say it's 50/50
* So if we rank all remaining states according to their A-level (meaining authoritarianism level), we should be able to do some intelligent betting: Bet on win in half the states, bet on lose in the rest.

### General thoughts on statistics, inference and the view of science in journalism

Making strange claims: 

* Proving both that authoritarianism is on the rise, that that is behind Trump's success, and that Trump attracts authoritarians. While proving one, they assume the others to be true.
* Affirming the consequent (think of it as "reverse implication"). A =\> B; B, therefore A.

[^spelling-authoritarianism]: I will get sick of typing that word sooooooo soon.
