The Hello World
---------

Welcome, friend, to Stag Land, home of HjortHjort.

I'm a software engineer *in spe* and a part time artist. I mostly dabble in music, but also in writing. I'm currently focusing almost all my energy at learning everything I can about software. Currently I'm dabbling in Java, PHP, HTML/CSS and bash. Half a year ago, my greatest computer skills were being dope and installing software, being able to format my hard drive and knowing how to download torrents. Today I'm aiming to become a PHP developer this summer, which mean I'm learning all I can about PHP and MySQL in the least time possible. I don't even know what road lies ahead, just that I intend to flick-flack down it like there's no tomorrow.
